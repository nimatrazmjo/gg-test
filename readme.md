## 🧐 Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

Every player in Empire has a castle. To let players attack another player’s castle, we need you to create armies of randomly
distributed troops (a troop is a formation of soldiers with the same skill, such as Spearmen, Swordsmen, Archers, etc.)
For example, we'll call your code telling it we need a random army that's 167 men strong. Assuming our available unit types to be,
for example, Spearmen, Swordsmen and Archers, what we want from you is that you tell us what such a random army would look
like.

, e.g.
Our Input: 167

Example result:
```
63 Spearmen

57 Swordsmen

47 Archers
```
